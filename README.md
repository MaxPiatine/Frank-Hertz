# Introduction
The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate the discrete/quantized energy levels in atoms by observing energy losses by electrons that scatter frrom atoms. This experiment helped to prove the theroized predictions of the models, as well as, established a key lead into the quantum description of an atom.\
The laboratory was conducted with the help of a hot cathode which will be used to accelerate the
electrons through the apparatus; a collecting plate such as an anode, which will be showered with
electrons and will transform the kinetic energy from the electrons into current; As well as, mercury
vapour tube, which the electrons will be colliding with elastically and inelastically to give a linear
sinusoidal wave due to high kinetic energy and atoms getting excited. The electrons will get shot
out of the cathode into the mercury vapour towards, just like figure 1, to land on the anode, which
is kept at a small, negative reverse-bias voltage. Any electrons that reach the anode will produce
current, and current is proportional to kinetic energy. The accelerating voltage can be adjusted
so that the electrons have higher or lower kinetic energies. The convenience is that, by definition,
an electron put through an accelerating voltage of 1V will receive 1eV of energy, which means
the accelerating voltage you set is roughly equal to the average kinetic energy of the electrons in
electron Volts (eV).
